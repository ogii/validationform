# validationform

A short form with JavaScript based validation.

## Description

This is a simple form that is validated using JavaScript. It is based off of a project by
Brad Traversy. I furthered the design by adding a background image, and changing the color scheme.

### Viewing the Project

Please clone this repository and open in your browser via directly opening the index.html file,
or running a live server.

There is a media query in the css so that the form can be viewed properly on mobile devices as well.

#### Furture Plans

I intend to keep updating this project by improving the form validation and improving the UI as well.

Thanks to Brad Traversy for providing the initial idea for this project.
